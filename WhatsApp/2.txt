22/03/23, 11:34 pm - Aditya👽: And i as soon as I came into the school took the newspaper and put it in fornt of Anuj sir and asked him to read it

03/04/23, 12:45 am - Aditya👽: I mean why do you think the most popular love movies include  the guy not getting the girl or the girl not getting the guy bcz we like tragedy we like drama our brains out functioned to think that everything has to be big and has to be meaningful and has to have to have some contribution to your life has to be talking point it doesn't really the really beauty lies in the simpleness of how things are done it lies if you actually around yourself you will realise that most of the time things that genrally have an impact our things that pretty normal ...that's why we showed crave for better things we showed crave to love things we have  that's the true meaning of loving things the way they are that is wisdom
03/04/23, 12:45 am - Aditya👽: What it means to be wise by Adi

01/06/23, 11:16 pm - Umyal Dixit: How do u know its from 1904
01/06/23, 11:17 pm - Aditya👽: In Imperial Russia, most political jokes were of the polite variety that circulated in educated society. Few of the political jokes of the time are recorded, but some were printed in a 1904 German anthology.

A man was reported to have said: "Nikolay is a moron!" and was arrested by a policeman. "No, sir, I meant not our respected Tzar, but another Nikolay!" - "Don't try to trick me: if you say 'moron', you are obviously referring to our Tsar!"
01/06/23, 11:17 pm - Aditya👽: Beacuse Wikipedia said so
01/06/23, 11:17 pm - Aditya👽: I was reading the Wikipedia article on Russian political jokes

09/06/23, 7:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: Why
09/06/23, 8:01 pm - Aditya👽: Cuz you are smart , you can speak fluent English, you have really high grades (however idk how much the score is to get into Howard ) and i think you can make a decent case on why you should get in in your collage application ( which as  i have seen in the net matters a lot ) .
09/06/23, 8:02 pm - Umyal Dixit: Well it does 
But i am losing the confidence to even apply
09/06/23, 8:02 pm - Umyal Dixit: A few people said i cannot do it

11/06/23, 7:02 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yes sir
11/06/23, 7:03 pm - Aditya👽: What is it about like whenever i watch a " wish I lived in the 80's" type of video there are 100s of comments mentioning stranger things and i thought the show was about monsters ?
11/06/23, 7:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: Well yea 
The show is def about monsters 
But its set in the 80s where a group of kids(nerds or weird kids idk) who play dungeons and dragons meet a girl(millie boby brown aka eleven in the series) and she has some kind of powers 
And theres this whole different world which is dark, filled with monsters but its the mirror image of the actual world so its called the upside down
And one kid from the group gets trapped there and they save him
11/06/23, 7:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: And then the story revolves around eleven and those kids 
Which include their parents, brother sisters and a police man
11/06/23, 8:01 pm - Aditya👽: Ohhhh ok

12/06/23, 11:21 pm - Aditya👽: <Media omitted>
12/06/23, 11:21 pm - Aditya👽: 😑

12/06/23, 11:21 pm - Umyal Dixit: Offc

Not for poets and authors
12/06/23, 11:22 pm - Aditya👽: Like anything before the 1960s was a bad time

12/06/23, 11:23 pm - Aditya👽: Lol
12/06/23, 11:23 pm - Umyal Dixit: But i have been obsessed with that time
12/06/23, 11:24 pm - Umyal Dixit: Watching series and reading classics
12/06/23, 11:24 pm - Umyal Dixit: Just made me more wanna go to that era
12/06/23, 11:24 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah but from what i have read of history that time sucked i mean no electricity no morden madicnd not even sliced bread  even dude
12/06/23, 11:24 pm - Aditya👽: Anyways
12/06/23, 11:25 pm - Umyal Dixit: But u know these things now so thats why u cannot imagine it
12/06/23, 11:25 pm - Umyal Dixit: But if u never knew what the hell they were
12/06/23, 11:25 pm - Umyal Dixit: U would be okay with that
12/06/23, 11:25 pm - Aditya👽: I have also have had a weird fascination with sub urban America and living there but
12/06/23, 11:27 pm - Aditya👽: Just this idea of good times in the 80s in America you know good  movies early video games great music and major historical events and the most consumer based society ever
12/06/23, 11:27 pm - Aditya👽: Like i have just spent the whole day watching interviews and movie trailers from the 80s
12/06/23, 11:27 pm - Aditya👽: I just can't get it out of my head
12/06/23, 11:27 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah i gusse so
12/06/23, 11:27 pm - Umyal Dixit: U do know thats when john lenon was shott
12/06/23, 11:28 pm - Aditya👽: Also me knowing very well about the politics of the time doesn't help
12/06/23, 11:28 pm - Aditya👽: Like i said major historical events
12/06/23, 11:28 pm - Aditya👽: And i am not that big of a fan of him
12/06/23, 11:28 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yes 
The good and the bad
12/06/23, 11:28 pm - Aditya👽: His music is good
12/06/23, 11:28 pm - Aditya👽: But he was a douchebag or atleast not a great person
12/06/23, 11:29 pm - Umyal Dixit: But u said ur a huge fan of the beatles
12/06/23, 11:29 pm - Umyal Dixit: Which includes 
Him
12/06/23, 11:29 pm - Aditya👽: I mean he publically left his high school sweetheart and his teenage son for a woman he met 2 years before that .
12/06/23, 11:30 pm - Aditya👽: Which was also a very big reason for the band's break up
12/06/23, 11:30 pm - Umyal Dixit: Well then 
Hes a bastard
12/06/23, 11:31 pm - Aditya👽: Ok i am a huge of the Beatles as in the music the movies the experience and the looks and style but i am not a very big fan of jhon Lenon and yeah the others were fine
12/06/23, 11:31 pm - Aditya👽: Even there individual music was not that good
12/06/23, 11:31 pm - Aditya👽: I mean they were great musicians but they all had massive egos and that stuff
12/06/23, 11:31 pm - Aditya👽: That is one major reason why the band broke up
12/06/23, 11:32 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ohhh
Got what u mean
12/06/23, 11:32 pm - Aditya👽: Except for ringo start he did everything he could to preserve the band he was the only one who let his ego down so that band could survive but that was unfortunatealy not enough
12/06/23, 11:33 pm - Umyal Dixit: Well i guess
If something had to end 
It did
12/06/23, 11:33 pm - Aditya👽: How you heard of "the art and the artist "?
12/06/23, 11:34 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yes 
The trend right
12/06/23, 11:34 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah the trend of spreaating the art from the artist
12/06/23, 11:38 pm - Aditya👽: While i do believe that the art of the artist is influenced by their personality at the same time i think that art is also pretty subjective what is a masterpiece to me might just be another simple song to you or which i think of as being the greatest you might think of them as the worst thats why i think to a certain degree one can separate the art from the artist but art will have influence from the artists personality and it merely depends and how much you can tolerate that like i   just like jhon Lenon but his music most of it is ok but some of it i love even if it is directly influenced by his shitty personality Idc bcz i am willing to tolerate that . So in conclusion the art will be influenced by the artist you can separate to the degree you can tolerate the artist . I hope that made sense .
12/06/23, 11:38 pm - Aditya👽: That's it
12/06/23, 11:38 pm - Umyal Dixit: https://youtu.be/sLSiw1c8ayc
12/06/23, 11:39 pm - Umyal Dixit: u ll get an idea why I am obsessed
12/06/23, 11:40 pm - Aditya👽: Ummm
12/06/23, 11:40 pm - Umyal Dixit: it certainly did
and I agree
12/06/23, 11:40 pm - Umyal Dixit: just lemme explain
12/06/23, 11:41 pm - Aditya👽: Check it again
12/06/23, 11:41 pm - Aditya👽: You sure that's the right link
12/06/23, 11:41 pm - Umyal Dixit: i did not watch the whole thing
12/06/23, 11:41 pm - Umyal Dixit: lemme just..
12/06/23, 11:41 pm - Aditya👽: Thats ok but
12/06/23, 11:41 pm - Aditya👽: Thats the wrong video
12/06/23, 11:42 pm - Umyal Dixit: wdym
what vid is showing
12/06/23, 11:42 pm - Aditya👽: Bcz you said you would like to live in Victorian England in the 1880s which i understand even but you sent the video talk about the 18th century
12/06/23, 11:42 pm - Aditya👽: That's the 1700s and a even miserable time
12/06/23, 11:42 pm - Aditya👽: Even in England
12/06/23, 11:43 pm - Umyal Dixit: waitt
12/06/23, 11:43 pm - Umyal Dixit: ye
12/06/23, 11:43 pm - Umyal Dixit: wrong vid
12/06/23, 11:43 pm - Aditya👽: Atleast the 1880s was better then that .
12/06/23, 11:43 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah that's what I thought 😹😹
12/06/23, 11:45 pm - Umyal Dixit: wait lemme
12/06/23, 11:51 pm - Aditya👽: https://youtu.be/SiaNn5UwTY0
12/06/23, 11:51 pm - Aditya👽: Such a great video
12/06/23, 11:54 pm - Umyal Dixit: One reason is that it had a large and powerful empire that spanned across the world.  Britain’s status as the most powerful empire in the world was one of the main reasons i wanna just live there.  at its height, the British Empire covered so much of the Earth’s total land area. Another reason is that it had a growing state and economy that was fueled by industrialization and trade .and Victorian era was characterized by a growing state and economy. Britain was the foremost global power for over a century and that its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions. 
like i am in that era where the major inventions took place, the railways, the telegraphs and such things
and ik that women had limited access to education, employment and property rights. They also faced a sexual double standard that restricted their freedom and dignity. However, some women challenged these norms and campaigned for social reforms such as suffrage, education and health care. 
and my major reason for the obsession is that Victorian culture was rich and diverse, influenced by both tradition and innovation. It produced so many of my fav writers like   Dickens, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Oscar Wilde and some scientists that i would have loves to see work on their theories like  Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison. It also offered many forms of entertainment such as theatres, music halls, museums, libraries, parks and gardens. and i wanna experience the grandness of that era
12/06/23, 11:56 pm - Umyal Dixit: at last i can say is  that living in 19th century England would feel exciting but also challenging; rewarding but also unfair; fascinating but also frightening; depending on who you were and where you lived.
12/06/23, 11:56 pm - Aditya👽: Where did you find this ?
12/06/23, 11:56 pm - Umyal Dixit: and i copied some stuff
write some on my own
12/06/23, 11:56 pm - Aditya👽: Ik you didn't have all this memorized
12/06/23, 11:56 pm - Umyal Dixit: and voila
12/06/23, 11:56 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah i knew
12/06/23, 11:56 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah i already i git that i didn't argue

14/06/23, 5:37 pm - Umyal Dixit: Lmfao 
Well maybe u wouldnt be so obsessed if were living in the 80s 
Yk about the other era after that 
And thats what makes u wanna live there more
14/06/23, 5:37 pm - Umyal Dixit: Plus the wrong country
14/06/23, 5:38 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah
14/06/23, 5:38 pm - Aditya👽: And it's more then that bro i have studied stuff i should not ahve studied
14/06/23, 5:38 pm - Aditya👽: Well
14/06/23, 5:38 pm - Aditya👽: You see
14/06/23, 5:38 pm - Aditya👽: According to un our climate is basically dommed
14/06/23, 5:40 pm - Aditya👽: The prospect of world war 3 is highest since 1962
14/06/23, 5:40 pm - Aditya👽: If not ukraine and
14/06/23, 5:40 pm - Aditya👽: Then it would china in Taiwan and all the intellectuals i watched all think that India will be at the centre 😭😭
14/06/23, 5:41 pm - Aditya👽: Like China trying to invade us and bombing us
14/06/23, 5:41 pm - Aditya👽: And our military is no where as good as China's that's a fact
14/06/23, 5:41 pm - Aditya👽: The Chinese have literally told it's citizens to prepare for war
14/06/23, 5:42 pm - Aditya👽: And also it is very clear that by 2030 we will be facing a very major food shortage
14/06/23, 5:43 pm - Aditya👽: And this all beacause the 60s where the youth (now boomers ) did stuff that was very good in the short run and the good results showed in teh 80s but now the problem comes 😭😭
14/06/23, 5:44 pm - Aditya👽: And also there is the fact that i am poor alright my parents somehow barely paid for my sisters collage i know they won't be able to pay for mine
14/06/23, 5:44 pm - Aditya👽: What will I do ?
14/06/23, 6:09 pm - Umyal Dixit: Will reply later
14/06/23, 6:09 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ttyl
15/06/23, 5:42 pm - Aditya👽: .
15/06/23, 5:50 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ah shit 
So sorrrry
15/06/23, 5:50 pm - Umyal Dixit: <Media omitted>
15/06/23, 5:50 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ohh
15/06/23, 5:53 pm - Umyal Dixit: I think 
Like not a strong opinion but i think
If modi continues to be the pm for any reason
Then the chances for the war would very much increase
The root will be india 
Muslims and hindu riots 
Like nazi and aryans in germany
And we all know what happened after that...
Muslim riots honge toh middle east will come in action
And .....
Aur agr yeh nhi 
Fir bhi if he is the pm for progressive times 
Then wars are for sure going to happen
15/06/23, 5:53 pm - Umyal Dixit: So yea ur rightt
15/06/23, 5:54 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yea cause its always on the peak
War from everybody
Almost everybody
And after covid
So many countries are against it
15/06/23, 5:54 pm - Umyal Dixit: Its declining everyday
15/06/23, 5:56 pm - Umyal Dixit: It happens after every major events
Like ww1
Yk how doomed we were
Then we grew our economy 
And boom ww2
Economy grew again 
So yea in future whtv war or major drastic event happen(which surely will cause its the process of nature) we all will suffer so much 
Then we would adapt and again grow
15/06/23, 5:57 pm - Umyal Dixit: Look if ur worried about the fact that ur poor and dunno how will u survive in the coming years
Then ur already doomed just by thinking that
And if u think how ur parents will pay for ur college then u can apply for education loan and pay later when u have a job 
Also u can do  a part time job along with ur college
15/06/23, 6:00 pm - Aditya👽: Well that's your view but no
15/06/23, 6:00 pm - Aditya👽: Not actually
15/06/23, 6:00 pm - Umyal Dixit: Also
Write some amazing thesis (which u can) on topics u think and have a opinion on
Per say u wanna go in journalism then write about any political topic
Or if u wanna go in history like a archeoligist
Maybe write about the 80s 
Prepare a thesis
An amazing one
And then find the colleges
Mail it to them 
Uk u will get entry in them 
With a 100% schloraship if they like it
15/06/23, 6:01 pm - Aditya👽: Kinda

18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Aditya👽: <Media omitted>
18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Aditya👽: <Media omitted>
18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Aditya👽: <Media omitted>

18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Aditya👽: <Media omitted>
18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Aditya👽: Exactly 💯💯💯
18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Umyal Dixit: As for ur sisters
I think the main reason is them being a female
18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Aditya👽: Oh lol
18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Umyal Dixit: Idk 
But that changes the whole perspectjve
18/06/23, 1:28 pm - Aditya👽: 💀
18/06/23, 1:29 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah ik
18/06/23, 1:29 pm - Umyal Dixit: Mum thinks they shant be scolded
18/06/23, 1:29 pm - Umyal Dixit: Sensatibe
18/06/23, 1:29 pm - Umyal Dixit: Blah blak
18/06/23, 1:29 pm - Aditya👽: A seriously belive that young men need older men to guide them
18/06/23, 1:29 pm - Aditya👽: I have been studying and thinking about politics and history in a much more different sense
18/06/23, 1:30 pm - Aditya👽: No doubt women have done tremendous work and are equal to men but when you look in the best weather good things or bad the driving force behind them were young men
18/06/23, 1:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yes 
And i being a single girl child dont have the right to say but
In a family of brothers and sisters
The brother is always the one who gets scolded
Cause the sisters too sensative 
And if there were only sisters thenthe older one gets scolded just cause she aint born a boy
18/06/23, 1:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: Typical indian mentality
18/06/23, 1:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yes
18/06/23, 1:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: Speaking of it
18/06/23, 1:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: I went to see adipurush yesterday
18/06/23, 1:31 pm - Aditya👽: A society prospered when old men teach young men to plant trees in shade of which they know will never sit
18/06/23, 1:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: And its practically a very bad vesrsion of ramayan
18/06/23, 1:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: But
18/06/23, 1:32 pm - Umyal Dixit: Coming to the main point
18/06/23, 1:32 pm - Umyal Dixit: I came to ralise
18/06/23, 1:32 pm - Aditya👽: There has been aoy of backlash
18/06/23, 1:32 pm - Aditya👽: On Twitter everybody is so mad about it
18/06/23, 1:33 pm - Umyal Dixit: Every freaking war in the history has the main reason 
Tje woman
Cause of her the war happens
Ramayana, sita
Mahabharat, draupadi
18/06/23, 1:33 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah
18/06/23, 1:33 pm - Umyal Dixit: I mean
I am a woman
I cant critisize em
But mann
It still it what it is
18/06/23, 1:36 pm - Aditya👽: You see 
In history young men have been the driving force of society and look at the data now tells that most young boys are lonely not married unahppy and angry and live in a feminine driven world where the modern feminist movement which controls most of media tends to focus on degrading men 
The gaurding a huge newspaper recently wrote an article saying " women should hate men " 
So the thing that a society where young men are not given priority will collapse it has collapsed in the past and it will .
18/06/23, 1:36 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yk the reason why ww2 happened was hitler
But he was the way he was because her mother never said anything and taught him those thjngs
Back story 
Reason
A woman
18/06/23, 1:38 pm - Aditya👽: Also the modern feminist movement tends to palce less focus on actual things like  science but the truth is the bitter unfortunate truth is that men and women biologicaly are not equal look at the afct that there are around 2000 professional male runners who can fatser then the fastest female runner of all time
18/06/23, 1:38 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yea 
I think it will be after a decade when these things wont matter
I think when we are in our 50s 
Then nobody would care
Cause i see the diff
Our generation doesnt have that kind of stereotypes
18/06/23, 1:38 pm - Umyal Dixit: And america has gotten so better in the past decade about women and black people
There is still danger but its farr better
18/06/23, 1:39 pm - Umyal Dixit: Anx i think same will happen in india
The equity will came in a dexade
18/06/23, 1:39 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah yk hitler loved his mother so much that his mother was treated by a Jewish doctor who didn't charge them anything as they could not pay so hitler allowed that jewish man   and his family to leave German respectfulky
18/06/23, 1:39 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ohh
18/06/23, 1:39 pm - Aditya👽: Hmm
18/06/23, 1:40 pm - Aditya👽: Yk hitler actually didn't want to kill jewsihs people
18/06/23, 1:40 pm - Umyal Dixit: Then
Was it his cancelllor?
18/06/23, 1:40 pm - Umyal Dixit: Why did he do it???
18/06/23, 1:41 pm - Aditya👽: He actually proposed what's called tha Madagascar plan where he proposed to make Madagascar the home of jewish people of earth but the British rejected saying it's inhumane so he went with plan b
18/06/23, 1:41 pm - Aditya👽: He tired to convince the British they didn't agree
18/06/23, 1:41 pm - Aditya👽: Bcz the French were not willing to give up their colony
18/06/23, 1:42 pm - Umyal Dixit: Well
Madagascar was far better than death
18/06/23, 1:42 pm - Aditya👽: He was the chancellor
18/06/23, 1:42 pm - Umyal Dixit: Even tho its unlivable
18/06/23, 1:42 pm - Umyal Dixit: No
When he was a army man
18/06/23, 1:42 pm - Umyal Dixit: There was a chancelloe
18/06/23, 1:42 pm - Umyal Dixit: Dont remember the name
18/06/23, 1:43 pm - Aditya👽: President+ chancellor= fureher ( supreme leader )
18/06/23, 1:43 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ahhh
18/06/23, 1:43 pm - Aditya👽: What ?that was ww1 Hitler did  not even hate Jews back then

Never reveals the original one

My sis might but my mother will be like def no the excuse will be studies but ik the reason she will say bcz she doesn't want to see us independent she gets insecure if she even sense that she losing control of our lives I mean I see it almost every day how she beats my sister ( aastha ), curses her out , Humiliates her and all sorts of things and if she says anything back she manipulates by crying and saying that you think just bcz you earn money you are above me . I am telling she has let it happen with aastha behen she will not let me be independent until I make myself so . And my father yeah yk about that ( this guy asked me "to just  walk home" ( public transport was stopped) when all kids were being picked up by their parents due to the water overflowing ) so yeah .

07/08/23, 9:23 pm - Aditya👽: Yk why the Germans were not able to develop the neuclear bomb before the American when they already achieved neuclear fission before anyone else .
07/08/23, 9:23 pm - Aditya👽: Neuclear fission being a key element in this .
07/08/23, 9:40 pm - Umyal Dixit: No why?
07/08/23, 9:42 pm - Aditya👽: Bcz of their own stupid rasicism since the earliest people to work on neuclear science were Jews the Nazis considered "jew science" and didn't think that it had anything to offer since the Jews were interested in it that's why the Nazi neuclear programme had thousand times less funding then the American one. Other wise teh Nazis could have had the neuclear bomb

11/09/23, 5:13 am - Aditya👽: Also there is the fact that jinha hates the ca t that we had the name India .
11/09/23, 5:13 am - Aditya👽: Oh ok
11/09/23, 5:13 am - Umyal Dixit: tell me more
11/09/23, 5:13 am - Aditya👽: Hated the fact .
11/09/23, 5:16 am - Umyal Dixit: hey ykw 
tell me bout this when u get home
u have a big test today
go study
11/09/23, 5:19 am - Aditya👽: Well the name India was given to people living the other side of the Indus  river by the Greeks around 2400 years ago . Pakistan now has most of the Indus this when in ab exhibition the name India was used for India and the word Pakistan fpr Pakistan jinha objected bcz ..
1) Pakistan was for Muslims this India is for Hindus so they should use hindustan ( his mindset rejected by nehru ) 
2. It made India look like the successor to the BRITISH INDIAN EMPIRE.  Remember the the word " India " has always had international value . There was never an emperor of Britain just the king of Britain also know as the "Emperor of India " and it made Pakistan look like a spreatist state not an independent one. Wo to yai Aaj bhi America kai upar dependent hai but still . And that is also why they won't change it ...the word India has a lot fo brand value and it would cost a lot and the jinha thing so yeah .
11/09/23, 5:22 am - Umyal Dixit: ohhh

11/09/23, 5:22 am - Umyal Dixit: I mean almost all of india isn't aware of this

15/09/23, 1:45 pm - Aditya👽: 🤨...in teh 60s new bands like the beatles broke and made recordd which ppl still can't do today . There was a culturalal revolution in the west . More countries became independent then other decade. The French new wave movement started which really is considered the backbone and orgin or morden cinema . Humans stepped foot on moon also in the same deadcade the first humans went to space .  Ww3 almost started during the Cuban missle crisis . Major wars such as vitenam and the  yam kapura war and well the indo china and indo pak war although not that major important for our country. Speaking for our country this decade saw most communal violence in our country. Indra Gandhi baiscally took over the Congress party making it what it is today that Is tool of the Congress party . Major bands like queen and took hold also one th 60s Beatles broke apart and the last American president to be assassinated jhon f Kennedy was... well .... assassinated and much more so yeah pretty weird or let's just eventful decade .

India currently does not have any kind of system like this but  after 5 months of developing a pan India alert system. The government tested it for the first time by sending a fake alert system in first English then Hindi .

25/09/23, 10:13 pm - Umyal Dixit: Agreed on ur statement
25/09/23, 10:14 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yeah makes sense a bit cause they have the knowledge of the past but liberals on the other hand just want change without thinking the causes and all
Not applicable for everywhere but yeah
25/09/23, 10:15 pm - Aditya👽: I mean look at it lia Thomas a trans woman was when a man not even in top 100 swimmers of America but as a now a " woman " she is no. 1.....c'mon man
25/09/23, 10:16 pm - Aditya👽: True true true 💯 i agree that's the thing
25/09/23, 10:16 pm - Umyal Dixit: It's absurd
25/09/23, 10:16 pm - Umyal Dixit: Like u are a man technically
25/09/23, 10:16 pm - Umyal Dixit: U have the strength of a man
25/09/23, 10:17 pm - Umyal Dixit: And yes I say that cause biologically men are tend to have more muscles
25/09/23, 10:19 pm - Umyal Dixit: Even tho u change urself into an alien per say but u still be as strong as a guy 
So it's not fair to label them as no1 if they are not biologically in that category
It's fine if u are taking both genders together but just women Idts It's right <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 10:19 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah see and  I support liberals and trans ppl on there thinking of gender disphoria . I mean it could be that you feel you are in the worng gender and youa re caple thinking adult you should be allowed to do what you want you shouldnt be discriminated against if you want to go sit in a restraunt dressed in female clothes and eat food there ...your choice but when we have men dressed as woman going into female bathrooms and then harrassing women there ....then that's  a problem..
25/09/23, 10:20 pm - Aditya👽: Yup
25/09/23, 10:21 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yeah definitely.
25/09/23, 10:23 pm - Aditya👽: And this absolute shit hotel of victim mentality seriously i can rn sit here and give you a hundred examples of liberals trying to victimize themselves it's absolute bullshit and this obbsesing with diversity. Like did you hear they making a live action snow whit and gusse what she is not white ij the movie .....the actress says she hate the original script.....teh 7 dwaerfs are not small anymore and now they are not white like they were in the original somehow they are also Mexican , balck and Indian ....like c'mon

12/10/23, 9:33 pm - Umyal Dixit: What started with a curiosity of opening up my late greataunt's telivision set and knowing whats inside the idiot box, i have come a long way where i have learned about innovations,equipments and devices as much as i could grasp in my school. When i was in  7th grade a lab opened in our school. At first it was nowhere of my intrest, i didnt knew what to do in there or neither was i allowed to go there. Soon after i was the head of the lab and people would come to me for all their problems, and i learned with every problem. But my curiosity for science did not just began there. My grandfather has played a big role in it. He was a retired police officer who was expirenced in technology and communication. From water taps to car engines, we never had to call for a mechanic cause he was always there to fix it. I still remember him having all kind of tools needed to do every task in the house there was. And i was always his little assistant,  i didnt do much but hold the flashlight,hand him tools or look at some tiny places where his eyes or hands couldnt reach but thats how we bonded.

29/11/23, 10:19 pm - Umyal Dixit: And as do I
29/11/23, 10:19 pm - Umyal Dixit: But u go first
29/11/23, 10:19 pm - Aditya👽: I was gonna say the same thing
29/11/23, 10:19 pm - Aditya👽: Ok
29/11/23, 10:22 pm - Aditya👽: 1. As u might remember i for some reason disconnected and was not able to.find joy in listening to music till July and even the only started last month and this month to properly do so Ithe amount is very less then i thought
2. Without my knowledge my father was listening to music from my account for 2 month ...so a lot of old Bollywood artist and songs which I did not listen to even once .
3...i forgot. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 10:24 pm - Aditya👽: I remember the third
29/11/23, 10:24 pm - Aditya👽: For some reason my Spotify is not allowing to see my wrapped on the app like I am clicking and nithings happening so...i am seeing my wrap on Google
29/11/23, 10:24 pm - Aditya👽: That's it .
29/11/23, 10:25 pm - Umyal Dixit: Alright 2nd is pretty much I as well
My account is logged in on TV and my mum listened to stuff which messed up the algorithm 
And second I didnt listened a Lotta music on spotify this year because major reason if I wanted to play something, I had Alexa for that 
Soo pretty much I have listened twice as much as spotify
29/11/23, 10:33 pm - Aditya👽: Yk i was so excited but when I saw it I kinda became disappointed like  not what i excepted but when you factor in everything it makes sense anyway let's see how it goes next year hopefully much better.

Like you had your reasons why it wasn't great but it's not that bad as well
29/11/23, 10:44 pm - Aditya👽: Well was kinda thinking the same .
1. Shawn ik he would be there .
2. Why no artists came in my Spotify wrapped to wish me merrry chritsimas. 😭
29/11/23, 10:45 pm - Umyal Dixit: I have premium for a week

29/11/23, 10:50 pm - Umyal Dixit: Well the top artists you had didn't made any messages

Also do you remember how we had a video call that was so long that my battery ran out and we had so much fun
You are literally steve to my robin (stranger things refrence)(ps except the fact robin in gay, i am not) 
I also know you may not feel the same way but its alright. I just wanted you to know....there is someone out there whos life you have made better by just being in it. 
Happiest birthday to you sir 
Have a great one

In 1972 usa and the most of the world recognised the communists as being the real china ( Since well they control most of the population and land ) and india has always since 1949 considered the communists china as being the real china ( bcz of nehru as he really trusted the communists and mao and believed they would be great allies to us ) (he was very wrong) ( and PPL like Patel warned him that they would betray and invade us ( 1962) but he didn't listen ). <This message was edited>

15/04/24, 10:45 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah but thats people the government atleast gives them legal protection by recognising that being homosexual is not wrong yk tej bjp has promised benifits for transgenders init manifesto and Congress manifesto says if they won they will leaglise same sex civil union which like if marriage and all the legal benifits of marrige just yk its not a marrige .
15/04/24, 10:47 pm - Umyal Dixit: Okay but 
The problem here is 
The govt accepts Transgenders 
But what about those who want to identify as woman or man and still want to marry the same sex
15/04/24, 10:47 pm - Umyal Dixit: They disgust them
15/04/24, 10:52 pm - Aditya👽: The biggest problem to same sex marrige in India . Is not just homophobia. Its that Islam and Christianity consider it morally wrong heck the Bible says that " if a man lays with a man they same way he lays with a women he should be put to death " no such thing has been said in our  religion or our culture ever . There is ample historical evidence that until the British ( who believed homosexual and transgenderism to be wrong) criminalised in the 1800s  such activities and started putting people in jail for it ppl usually excepted as normal in India . Even muslim rulers who were oppossed  to it atleast did not criminalise it in a traditional sense Akbar even talks about the generosity shown by Hindus to transgender and "feminine men " and says that's its great they are accepted as equal he believed through reforms the muslims could too be made to execpet them as equal . That's why I support a uniform civil code that's one of the only measures I 100% support the Modi government on .
15/04/24, 10:52 pm - Aditya👽: I am not gonna talk about that bcz I am simply exaushed enough that I can't
15/04/24, 10:55 pm - Umyal Dixit: I agree with the fact that Hindus did not have a problem with that as there are so many scriptures showing images of two man or woman with each other 
And yes there is a fact that what Is believed to be the roots of our culture are merely just some very old theories of the west that were put into the minds of Indians
15/04/24, 10:55 pm - Umyal Dixit: Alright
15/04/24, 10:56 pm - Aditya👽: Exactly that's why I dont understand the people who claim to proper pure Hindus but then support a version of Hinduism that was altered by muslim rulers and British colonists according to their own world view .
15/04/24, 10:56 pm - Aditya👽: Aur fir yai 14 saal Kai Sigma male Jo kuch bhi bakwas support karte hai bhai kyuki sigam hai Sigma 🤡
15/04/24, 10:57 pm - Umyal Dixit: People don't try to understand their history but merely just follow what their ancestors followed
15/04/24, 10:57 pm - Aditya👽: That even upto their grandfathers .
15/04/24, 10:57 pm - Aditya👽: If I did that I would be practicing untouchability 💀
15/04/24, 10:57 pm - Umyal Dixit: Who were influenced by the british
15/04/24, 10:57 pm - Aditya👽: Exactly
15/04/24, 10:57 pm - Umyal Dixit: Damnnn 
I just realised
15/04/24, 10:57 pm - Umyal Dixit: Yess
15/04/24, 10:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: And we would be treating everyone as they are below us and should respect us
15/04/24, 10:58 pm - Aditya👽: Hmm
15/04/24, 10:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: Anyway
15/04/24, 10:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: Lemme
15/04/24, 10:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: Read the KMY
15/04/24, 10:59 pm - Aditya👽: Sure
15/04/24, 10:59 pm - Umyal Dixit: KMT
15/04/24, 11:28 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ohhh
15/04/24, 11:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: So KMT is actually from China but later went to Taiwan
And what we consider China isn't the whole China
It's just the mainland 
And Nehru was wrong after all that China will be our ally
I wonder what would have happened if patel were the one to make decisions at that time
I still believe he was the greatest among them
Far better than gandhi and Nehru
Not that Nehru was a bad person, he did great to our country but 
Idk it's just my theory, I really look upto patel  tho <This message was edited>
15/04/24, 11:32 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ohh
I didn't knew congress was in allies with the communists
15/04/24, 11:34 pm - Umyal Dixit: Why does America always have to bug into things
15/04/24, 11:36 pm - Aditya👽: What ? Its good . Look i know you will understand if I tell you ....but rn I don't want to do yeah but just know by all foreign policy measures it made snes in 1949 for America to get involved and it makes sense now
15/04/24, 11:36 pm - Aditya👽: India alliance.
15/04/24, 11:37 pm - Umyal Dixit: No no nooo
I did not mean it in the bad way
I am just trying to say that America bugs into things a lott
15/04/24, 11:37 pm - Aditya👽: Nehru was too ideological and too much of beliver in pacifism.....one is his greatest faults and don't count gandhi into this....he was not a politician neither should we believe him to be
15/04/24, 11:37 pm - Aditya👽: Hm
15/04/24, 11:38 pm - Umyal Dixit: But gandhi was a great influence in major political decisions
15/04/24, 11:38 pm - Umyal Dixit: Plus he was part of the INV
15/04/24, 11:38 pm - Umyal Dixit: Inc
15/04/24, 11:38 pm - Umyal Dixit: And somehow i believe he was in a way also playing a political game
15/04/24, 11:38 pm - Umyal Dixit: Idk
15/04/24, 11:40 pm - Aditya👽: He wasn't. He gave up his membership in 1924 . He was a spiritual leader to inc members but he never claimed any leadership he actually wanted the Congress to dissolve itself beliveing that by achieving independence they have served their purpose to the nation. Gandhi didn't believe in government. He believed villages and cities should rule themselves so yeah we can't take gandhi into this.
15/04/24, 11:40 pm - Umyal Dixit: Like the Bhagat Singh case
He could have prevented if he wanted it to
But to spread his and only his ideologies he said he supports Bhagat But doesn't support his path
In a way he just wanted that his ideology was correct, his way was correct
15/04/24, 11:40 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ohh
I wasn't aware of that
15/04/24, 11:41 pm - Aditya👽: Agar khelna hota na tu dictator ban jata koi awaz nahi utha ta . Agar khelna hota tu jab Mountbatten in Delhi bolaya tha 15 aug 1947 ko tu nokhali mai refuges Kai sath baithke Kahan kha rahe hote .
15/04/24, 11:43 pm - Umyal Dixit: But just tell me one thing
Separate from the topic 
Gandhi never took ideas of others but only followed his own
He didn't like those who didn't follow him
Does it make him a bit egoistic?
15/04/24, 11:43 pm - Aditya👽: No he couldn't that's a very distorted right wing belive first of all gandhi wanted all prisoners to be released but lord Irwin only allowed for political prisoners and gandhi agreed since all major leaders were registered as so . And bhagat Singh was registered as a terrorist by the British even then British agreed to let bhagat singh go if he apologized gandhi wrote multiple letters m asking him to do so he could continue his movement but out of his own honour bhagat singh refused to apologise.
15/04/24, 11:44 pm - Umyal Dixit: What really
15/04/24, 11:44 pm - Aditya👽: How can we then blame gandhi
15/04/24, 11:44 pm - Umyal Dixit: I read the wrong sources then
15/04/24, 11:44 pm - Umyal Dixit: I didn't knew the whole thing
15/04/24, 11:45 pm - Umyal Dixit: Maybe I should take my words back
15/04/24, 11:45 pm - Umyal Dixit: There must be something I have said wrong here as well
15/04/24, 11:49 pm - Aditya👽: Exactly see  myth that Gandhi was not at all responsible for independence and was actually playing a cunning game or whatever originated in the 1952 when savarkar ( who apologized to the British, agreed he would work for them , refused to take anti British activities, said in his apology letter " I will be a loyal servant to his majesty the great king " , he refused hindu muslim unity, and three years before muslim league and jinha in 1937  he accepted and supported partion )  what party was he part of? hindu shabha.  what ideology did he inspire ? Hindutva? Who followed hindutva ? Bjp . Which has been in power for the past 10 years ? Bjp . Which party has been pushing a pro savarkar agenda ? Bjp and who did godse the brutal killer of gandhi consider his inspiration? Savarkar . Who was a coward and British bootlicking agent ? Savarkar . <This message was edited>
15/04/24, 11:50 pm - Aditya👽: Now tell me you Who is wrong ?
15/04/24, 11:50 pm - Umyal Dixit: Soo basically
15/04/24, 11:50 pm - Umyal Dixit: Savarkar was a bloody side changer
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Umyal Dixit: And hence the movie recently came
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Umyal Dixit: To promote the bjp
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Umyal Dixit: Agenda
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Umyal Dixit: In a way
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Aditya👽: You didn't read the wrong sources . You read a distorted truth which has been and is being distorted by the bjp yo full fill its ideology. Its sickening to see this re writing of history happen in front of my eyes .
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Umyal Dixit: I have not seen it but I planned to
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Umyal Dixit: But now I think
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Umyal Dixit: Its all maybe just for elections
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Aditya👽: Yeah another propaganda movie which floped and rightfully so .
15/04/24, 11:51 pm - Umyal Dixit: So people watch it and then promote bjp agenda
15/04/24, 11:52 pm - Aditya👽: Hmm
15/04/24, 11:52 pm - Umyal Dixit: So basically it was Savarkar who was in the wrong
15/04/24, 11:52 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ohhh
15/04/24, 11:53 pm - Umyal Dixit: But why would bjp make gandhi look bad?
15/04/24, 11:53 pm - Umyal Dixit: Because he was in favour of inc?
15/04/24, 11:53 pm - Umyal Dixit: And just for politics they be doing this
15/04/24, 11:53 pm - Aditya👽: Well it's complicated for most of his life he did take part in the independence movement but after 1925 he did nothing but promote hindu muslim divide and receive 60 RS per month pension by the British
15/04/24, 11:54 pm - Aditya👽: Agar 1925 Sai phele savarkar nai ho Kara wo continue rakhte tu mai bhi Aaj savarkar Kai anrae lagata
15/04/24, 11:55 pm - Aditya👽: Are khud bhagat singh in one of his essays said " if india is to progress the youth shall follow nehru and neta ji "
15/04/24, 11:55 pm - Umyal Dixit: His greed made him bad?
15/04/24, 11:55 pm - Aditya👽: And yk what neta ji said about svarakr
15/04/24, 11:55 pm - Aditya👽: Exactly bro .
15/04/24, 11:56 pm - Aditya👽: He wrote " if india is to get independence they cannot trust either savarkar or jinha they are both sides. Of the same coin" now i don't know about you but I truth neta ji
15/04/24, 11:57 pm - Umyal Dixit: I need to take my history lessons again😭
15/04/24, 11:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: But tell me one thing
15/04/24, 11:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: How would i know who is right and wrong if bjp has altered the history
15/04/24, 11:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: Telling me savarkar was a good person
15/04/24, 11:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: But he wasn't
15/04/24, 11:59 pm - Umyal Dixit: How do I know which sources to trust
15/04/24, 11:59 pm - Umyal Dixit: What if what I am reading is also been altered
16/04/24, 12:00 am - Aditya👽: And yk what the bjp'ites are saying and said in the movie that bhagat Singh was inspired savrakr which is false bcz 
A) bhagat was a communistz savarkar called communists one of our biggest enemies ( by ours his mean Hindus ) 
B) bhagat singh was. Not a bootlicking, loyal servant of the king 🤡 
And lastly 
Bhagat singh despised religion he belived it tj be the greatest evil , he litterly wrote a book called " why I am an atheist ?" ( Pretty good ) 
And savarkar the British bootlicker wanted a hindu rastra 🤡


Now they are spewing bs propaganda to dimish gandhi and nehru and put forword savarkar as a great saviour when he wasn't . He was British double agent and not a patriot buta traitor.
16/04/24, 12:01 am - Aditya👽: Its 12!
16/04/24, 12:01 am - Umyal Dixit: Indeed
It's 12!!
16/04/24, 12:02 am - Aditya👽: No you just need to do more in-depth and plz we cannot be sure what is true or not make sure what you are studying is neutral cuz a lot right wing bias has already infiltrated our media .
16/04/24, 12:02 am - Umyal Dixit: Yes even Bhagat used to follow gandhi till he called of the disobedience movement
16/04/24, 12:03 am - Aditya👽: Exactly atleast they are actively trying to
16/04/24, 12:03 am - Aditya👽: Yeah exactly .
16/04/24, 12:03 am - Umyal Dixit: Yeah
16/04/24, 12:04 am - Umyal Dixit: I gonna read tharoor🫠
16/04/24, 12:04 am - Umyal Dixit: But I need to have a great lit for that
16/04/24, 12:04 am - Umyal Dixit: God 
Sometimes I feel I am so far behind and need to catch up on a lottt
16/04/24, 12:06 am - Aditya👽: Look i don't like dhruv rathee but he really made a great video on savarkar plz watch it once and mohak Mangal made a great video on savarkar watch it as well he provides ample evidence for what he says . . I am actually currently reading a book called "  why they  killed gandhi "and it is a great source . Look history is subjective while there could be objective truths their interpretations can never be one I say read all the sources as much as you can and then make your own opinion for that is the only path to freedom is to have your own opinion or atleast your own sense of life .
16/04/24, 12:06 am - Umyal Dixit: Send me the links
16/04/24, 12:07 am - Aditya👽: I hope you understand what I am saying .
16/04/24, 12:07 am - Umyal Dixit: Yes that is ture
16/04/24, 12:07 am - Umyal Dixit: True
16/04/24, 12:07 am - Aditya👽: https://youtu.be/hXyi3LN1D1k?si=OlRt8u8wcj4JGZCE
16/04/24, 12:07 am - Aditya👽: https://youtu.be/ryBA3kVJdx8?si=NlhLrjvjkRAE9LHH
16/04/24, 12:08 am - Umyal Dixit: OK will watch them later
16/04/24, 12:09 am - Aditya👽: There is actually much more such as how and when savrakr started his myths and how they were preptuated but now I am exhausted
16/04/24, 12:09 am - Umyal Dixit: Yes u must be
Tell me sometime later or if u don't have the energy just send me a website link where it explains it all
16/04/24, 12:09 am - Umyal Dixit: Some other day ofc
16/04/24, 12:10 am - Umyal Dixit: Also also
16/04/24, 12:10 am - Umyal Dixit: Tell me some good movies or series
16/04/24, 12:10 am - Umyal Dixit: If u can
16/04/24, 12:10 am - Aditya👽: Sure
16/04/24, 12:10 am - Aditya👽: Later definitely
16/04/24, 12:10 am - Aditya👽: Rn look at this
16/04/24, 12:11 am - Aditya👽: <Media omitted>
16/04/24, 12:11 am - Aditya👽: Which must work with the britsh bot oppose he said after receiving a 60rs per month pension
16/04/24, 12:12 am - Umyal Dixit: Hinduism and great Britain to be friends???
Whattt
16/04/24, 12:12 am - Aditya👽: Yk baghat singh did not write an apology letter however he wrote a lette
16/04/24, 12:12 am - Umyal Dixit: Bros speaking as if india doesn't have any other religions
16/04/24, 12:12 am - Aditya👽: A letter demanding that he should be killed by a gun instead of hanging since he was only working for the nation and nothing he did was terroristic.
16/04/24, 12:13 am - Aditya👽: Pathetic
16/04/24, 12:13 am - Aditya👽: That's the man the bjp'ites say was inspired by svarakar 😑
16/04/24, 12:14 am - Umyal Dixit: And he was only kept in the terrorist category as he was gaining a lot of followers rapidly while for gandhi it took time and the British thought of gandhi as harmless to them butbhagat was really influential on Indians and they couldn't tolerate him and for his rapid death they had to classify him into a terrorist
16/04/24, 12:16 am - Aditya👽: Hmm
16/04/24, 12:17 am - Umyal Dixit: Yk Sometimes I wonder 
Rather than a party system there should be multiple layers to select 4-5 candidates for such a big  position 
Like requiring basic education, knowing the constitution, clearing the interview 
I mean
Tum IAS ko to itni layers se pass krake bnate ho...jinko corrupt na hote hue bhi hona padta h 
Lkin desh ke leaders ke lie sab choot h
Koi bhi aao
16/04/24, 12:18 am - Umyal Dixit: I think this is a flaw in our democracy
16/04/24, 12:19 am - Aditya👽: Agreed
16/04/24, 12:19 am - Aditya👽: Mohak Mangal actually made a great video on this as well .
16/04/24, 12:19 am - Umyal Dixit: And after those candidates are selected
The public should be allowed to vote on them
16/04/24, 12:20 am - Umyal Dixit: Oh
Send me the link
16/04/24, 12:20 am - Aditya👽: Just search mohak Mangal leaders education ( that is litteraly the title)

21/04/24, 9:18 pm - Aditya👽: He also used a wrong half quote from Manmohan Singh and said muslims are a burden on the nation's having the most kids .... This claim is extremely stupid since data realised by his own government says that this claim is false 🙂
21/04/24, 9:24 pm - Umyal Dixit: Waawww
21/04/24, 9:24 pm - Umyal Dixit: Just woahh
21/04/24, 9:24 pm - Umyal Dixit: That is seriously very much absurd
21/04/24, 9:25 pm - Aditya👽: Exactly
21/04/24, 9:25 pm - Umyal Dixit: Ngl I really think that he won't go down on his own will but like how Sikhs took Indira Gandhi out
Muslims might do that
21/04/24, 9:26 pm - Aditya👽: Hmm

24/04/24, 10:15 pm - Aditya👽: Yes ...so if an Indian truly cares about manipur who showed they vote the party which did not control it ...did not abolish the state government due to the selfishness of the fact that it's the rulling state government....and allowed for the violence to spread .
24/04/24, 10:16 pm - Umyal Dixit: But it isn't the right thing eitherr
24/04/24, 10:16 pm - Umyal Dixit: Aghh

05/05/24, 12:53 am - Umyal Dixit: Like the fact he invested in brothers of his favorite wife?
05/05/24, 12:53 am - Aditya👽: Yeah

06/05/24, 7:24 am - Umyal Dixit: I am telling you
This case in not closed!
06/05/24, 3:35 pm - Aditya👽: Hm
08/05/24, 5:41 pm - Umyal Dixit: Wait what?
08/05/24, 5:41 pm - Aditya👽: He has lost it ✨
08/05/24, 5:44 pm - Umyal Dixit: <Media omitted>
08/05/24, 5:47 pm - Aditya👽: Unfortunately
08/05/24, 5:48 pm - Aditya👽: The adani and Ambani whose wealth has gone up by like 1000% under him and who are the biggest funders of his party he has now accused then of making secret deal with Congress <This message was edited>
08/05/24, 5:52 pm - Aditya👽: Now what will all the news networks owned by adani and Ambani who praise him constantly do ? They 24/7 report every claim by Modi how will they report this one 😂
08/05/24, 5:54 pm - Umyal Dixit: 💀💀
08/05/24, 5:54 pm - Umyal Dixit: This is total insanity
08/05/24, 5:55 pm - Umyal Dixit: And I dont know how still there are people who are so blind
08/05/24, 5:57 pm - Umyal Dixit: I saw in news today that someone claimed that the Pulwama attack was curated and planned by Modi and the defense just straight up gave up and said nothing 
Like even his own party members no longer Have words to defend him
08/05/24, 5:58 pm - Aditya👽: This clearly shows he is losing ( I am not saying he will be defeated ) but I now 100% beloved that he doesn't think he will get a majority on his own and this is something the bjp boasts about that since 2014 a full majority government has allowed for economic growth so having less then 272 seats will be equal to defeat ..... Italy won ww1 but they didn't gain a lot actually gained a very less then they had hoped so the victory of ww1 was termed as the "vittoria mutilata" or " the mutilated victory " or the damaged victory .
08/05/24, 5:59 pm - Aditya👽: This is what he is afraid of happening and this is what's happening on the ground .
08/05/24, 6:00 pm - Aditya👽: Oh yeah that's was Satyapal Malik the governed of jummu and Kashmir at the time of pulwama and guess what  he said another attack will happen and another attack did happen.
08/05/24, 6:20 pm - Umyal Dixit: But don't you think even tho if he loses some seats he's just gonna buy em 
After all the whole electrol system is corrupt by now and even if they aren't, it's a gang so they would just threaten them to gain more seats
08/05/24, 6:21 pm - Umyal Dixit: No that was a claim he made when the attack happened
This issue was highlighted again in the news
08/05/24, 6:23 pm - Aditya👽: But no. Don't lie if they don't get 272+ seat belive me after the election even if bjp wins he will be removed from pm chair .
08/05/24, 6:23 pm - Umyal Dixit: Who knows man
08/05/24, 6:23 pm - Aditya👽: No he said another attack before 2024 elections will and teh recent poonch attack which killed one solider and injured 4
08/05/24, 6:24 pm - Umyal Dixit: Oh gotcha
12/05/24, 10:56 am - Aditya👽: <Media omitted>

13/05/24, 12:18 am - Aditya👽: Just the other day I was watching an interview of Singapores first pm and the father of the current one ...Lee Kuan yew ..the man took what basically a big slum of poor wage workers and single handedly turned it into one of the worlds richest powers ( Singapore) ...he said that in 1993 our pm narasimharao went to Singapore he then said to Lee " you have so many tourist why not send some to india " Lee agreed and then his team made a model of new buildings hotel and an airport to built around Chennai a whole new city just for tourists ....the only problem  ....the airport will be a joint venture of Singapore airlines and tata and they will private players ( Singapore airlines is not controlled by the Singapore government) ....and they will compete with air india ( at the time owned by our government now 60% by tata and adani group...Modi ji ki kartut) ....and this would have been good since to compete aur india would grow ....but guess one do the ministers did not like it bcz since the 50s his family had held the ministry of airlines and the minister said right there " no air india is our family heirloom this can't be allowed and since the minister was from. Family that had been in Congress for so long and was close to the gandhi family pv narshinarao could not say anything and the pm was overruled....aise hogi economic growth 🤡

13/05/24, 8:44 am - Umyal Dixit: Exactly this should not happen
13/05/24, 8:47 am - Umyal Dixit: Exactly

14/05/24, 6:26 pm - Aditya👽: Believe me I know her she will definitely take their side . Subha sun nahi paya mummy aur unki baat but I think she was on papa's side.
14/05/24, 6:26 pm - Aditya👽: These people seriously don't think  I should be given even a single chance
14/05/24, 6:26 pm - Aditya👽: But jab Tak wo Ghar nahi aayi baat karke koi fayada bhi nahi bcz I think she will be a Lil bit sympathetic
14/05/24, 6:27 pm - Umyal Dixit: Hmm

14/05/24, 6:27 pm - Umyal Dixit: Dadu se discuss kar?

14/05/24, 6:29 pm - Umyal Dixit: Really?
14/05/24, 6:30 pm - Aditya👽: Sadly yes . I mean my father is gonna make a decision without consulting him anyway but yeah he did say shit when my father said this stuff to him .
14/05/24, 6:31 pm - Aditya👽: Didn't*
14/05/24, 6:31 pm - Umyal Dixit: Acha just tell me one thing

14/05/24, 6:33 pm - Aditya👽: But bhene he tu inki side especially tripati.
14/05/24, 6:33 pm - Umyal Dixit: Aur mummy us baat se agree hai ki agr bhene padh likh jaaye aur bhai na padhe?
14/05/24, 6:33 pm - Aditya👽: Prevention is better than cure . Its better make it so he doesn't have this stuffer in the first place.
14/05/24, 6:34 pm - Aditya👽: She is very prusasive easily Maan lengi . Abni batiyo ko padha lia is burden pai kyu paise waste karne
14/05/24, 6:34 pm - Umyal Dixit: Let's just wait for the future
14/05/24, 6:35 pm - Aditya👽: As of now there is  no future

Beta chaiye tha isi liye hi na
Toh ab us bete ko padhne ka moka toh de(sorry if I offend u)
14/05/24, 6:36 pm - Aditya👽: I am gonna have to try but think ek tarfa yai unki batiya jo merse older hai are a lot closer to her plus my father who would rather see me dead on one side these people versus me ... Its a one sided battle
14/05/24, 6:37 pm - Aditya👽: Sahi baat hai . What was the need if yahi karna tha .
14/05/24, 6:37 pm - Umyal Dixit: But why does he have a rage against you?
14/05/24, 6:38 pm - Aditya👽: He has always had this . He never liked me never will I don't why and I don't want to . I know the moment I have even a little bit of a chance i will leave and he is dead to me ... Mai tu is admi ki arthi uthane bhi na aao
14/05/24, 6:39 pm - Aditya👽: Maybe that's why so I can't get away maybe that's why this is being done m
14/05/24, 6:39 pm - Aditya👽: Main question is triapti ko kya hoa like Maine kabhi kuch nahi Kara what does she want in the name " mummy papa ko bacha Rahi ho " she is advocating so I can't have even a chance at future .

21/07/24, 7:26 pm - Aditya👽: This poster was made after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus . Crpryus was an island in the Mediterranean sea it was controlled by Greeks but then by the ottam empire and from 1800s by the British ... In 1960 the British left and the modern republic of Cyprus was established. The republic worked fine but there were tensions between the Greek population and the Turkish population in 1965 Greece had a military coup in which the monarchy was overthrown . After this the Military government in Greece started supporting EOAK a fascist Greek organisation and in Cyprus in 1974 EOAK overthrew the Cyprus government after a turk was elected president and started massacring Turkish citizens . The Turkish government under Ecevit then sent the military to intervene and overthrew the EOAK government...well they were successfully the EOAK government was overthrown and so was the military government in Greece abd the Turkish military occupied the Turkish dommited north Cyprus and then later declared the creation of the Republic of north Cyprus which is only recognised by turkey in the entire world. Ecevit was overthrown himself in a military coup later that year  however he did return and become PM many times  before dying in 2006 . <This message was edited>

Fun fact : in the 60s he voted against legalisation of homosexuality and still holds pretty homophobic views and he is replacing Frances first gay pm .

03/10/24, 1:41 pm - Umyal Dixit: I mean
A person can live without a father but not food
03/10/24, 1:45 pm - Aditya👽: No .1 sent by someone ... The kid is not saying this out of his own hunger ...he has been asked to say this 
No.2 yk how big of a problem this was ... 30 percent of all men aged 18-30 died in the Soviet union without young men to work in factories and other ( remember this is the 1950s women were still not that free ) 
Yk how much till it took on their economy. And a child without a father .... I mean the emotional toll that comes with that

10/10/24, 12:17 am - Umyal Dixit: Yo
10/10/24, 12:17 am - Umyal Dixit: Need a favor
10/10/24, 12:17 am - Aditya👽: Sup
10/10/24, 12:17 am - Umyal Dixit: Just tell me some facts, points or in general what you think about
10/10/24, 12:17 am - Aditya👽: About what ?
10/10/24, 12:18 am - Umyal Dixit: Youth in parliament 
Is it rheotic or reality
10/10/24, 12:18 am - Aditya👽: I don't get that second part
10/10/24, 12:18 am - Umyal Dixit: Like what do you think about the youth being in parliament
10/10/24, 12:19 am - Umyal Dixit: Is it good or not
10/10/24, 12:19 am - Umyal Dixit: Give like everything you would say
10/10/24, 12:19 am - Umyal Dixit: Some facts and points
10/10/24, 12:26 am - Aditya👽: 1 ) It's good 
2) The more youth participate  the better we can be prepared for the future challenges cuz the youth will be the one facing this challanges 
3) the avg age of the current lok sabha is 56 ... That means People born in the 70s with a 90s education are ruling over us . More youth means a more knowing generation with better knowledge will be in power bcz every generation gains new knowledge over their life span which  they pass on . 
4) the global avg for mps is 53 which means we have more older people then othe countries in our parliament which is never good 
5) more youth means liberal Ideals regarding sexuality and gender Can be worked upon as younger people tend to be more liberal ( use this point depending upon the audience) 
6 ) old People are settled in they have a house and degree . More youth means that  youth centric issues  like lower housing ( which worldwide including india are sky high ) and lower collage tuition  can be better worked upon since a representative is more likely to work upon issues that they can easily relate too . <This message was edited>
10/10/24, 12:26 am - Aditya👽: How's this ? .
10/10/24, 12:28 am - Umyal Dixit: This is good
Thankyou
Give more insights if you can
10/10/24, 12:28 am - Aditya👽: Okay
10/10/24, 12:39 am - Aditya👽: To get more youth in parliament we can 
1) bring reservation for youth : a certain amount of seats being reserved for people between the age group of 25-35 
2) encourage  established politicians to reach out to the youth 
3) Require political parties to give leadership roles to young people in their party 
4 ) Introduce term limits for sitting MPs ( usually 2 terms at most ) 
5) Introduce the retirement age for MP's ( currently mps don't have a retirement age not even the us or uk ) 
6 ) establish a social system where after a. Certain age even in political parties Leaders Are expected to give up any power to young people ( this was actually proposed in the 50s look up Kamraj plan ) 
 
Now the two biggest downsides to all this are obviously that
1) it could encourage nepotism at a very high rate 
2) it could encourage political instability as young people are more inexperienced.......
however the Pros outweigh the cons <This message was edited>

10/10/24, 1:01 am - Aditya👽: So if it's an active debate ( point-counterpoint) a lot you would have to make up on the spot . Just push them on the basic fact that the youth is the future .... The people in power will be gone when the ultimate challenges of this century will come afront if the youth dont understand the system bcz they never got a chance to be in the system well when unpredictable challenges  come that would  cause a lot of problem and chaos  which they won't be able to deal with ...and a great example could be of The last Russian Tsar Nicholas the 2nd ...Now everybody will think " wait what that monarchy " but ask them to  listen for a second.... The biggest problem with his rule and what ultimately led to his dynasty's downfall and the chaos of the Russian revolution and after that the brutal dictatorship of the Soviet union was that his father  Tsar Alexander died early and never taught Nicholas how to rule over the vast Russian Empire and well Nicholas couldn't and he could not deal with future problems like WW1 ( he got crowned in 1895) Russia was really badly beaten in the War by germans at first and  that laf to things like  starvation and eventually a civil war .... he had to abdicate his throne  ( give up his throne ) now granted  we are not a Monarchy we are a federal parliamentary republic and we have a consensus based decision making process MPs and MLAs have to agree for a certain act to be passed that affects the lives of 100s of millions of people and thats why our Problem are actually much bigger then what tsar Nicholas had bcz Not only are our challenges extremely different and more unpredictable but also we have to not  only teach one person how to rule but a whole generation and the quicker we do it the better and it has to start With the people in power that have to either do it themselves or be convinced by the public to let youth in power bcz as The American politician Rick Synder once said Society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in ..... <This message was edited>

04/12/24, 7:53 pm - Umyal Dixit: Let's not talk about that
04/12/24, 7:53 pm - Umyal Dixit: Invigilator problems
04/12/24, 7:53 pm - Aditya👽: Ohh
04/12/24, 7:54 pm - Umyal Dixit: Asked out of syllabus question in viva
04/12/24, 7:58 pm - Umyal Dixit: Well mostly because
Up until August I didn't listen to  music a lot(mixed up with JEE and majorly other things)
In AUGUST I did
So it makes the listening hours reasonable 
Now talking about my top song, since that song was the very first song in one of my Playlist which is linked to my alarm, that one is the first to play almost every morning (so explains why it is my top even though I dont like that much)
Talking about my top artist, sure every year it's the same but this year I did not listen to him that much but since he's the only one whose most songs I listened to, he's the top one
I explored others more than I listened to him
So anyways
Its alr
04/12/24, 7:58 pm - Aditya👽: Well talk in bit mummy papa abhi abhi wapas aaye hai ( kal Raat ko gaon agye Thai ... Family wedding)

15/01/25, 9:18 pm - Aditya👽: This in turn references a pretty famous episode in Turkish history when the  Islamist prime minister of turkey Adan Merdendes ( who was killed in a millitary coup after he tried to establish an Islamist dictatorship) wrote to Ziya Gökalp ( father of pan Turanism - a racist Fascistic ideology that believes that the Turks are the supreme race ) . He asked Gokalp if he was Kurdish (Kurds being an iranic minority group in turkey who turks are pretty Racist towards and many Kurds have started a Military insurgency for a separate kurdistan ) anyway Goplak actually never replied so maybe he was a kurd who believed in Turkish Supremacy lol ... <This message was edited>

19/01/25, 10:23 pm - Aditya👽: Well you see . I watch this channel called spilling the milk .. its 3 friends jack , kor and eden ( one Canadian and two Americans) and they react to cartoons like family guy or South park and sometimes movies ( mainly animated like Cars ) and I like them bcz they are genuinely funny and add something to their reactions ..it's the only reaction based stuff I watch other then once in 6 months when I watch white people react indian Republic day parade  ( just like how fucking amazed they are by Soliders doing stunts ) anyway I was watching their reaction to the amazing Spiderman with Andrew Garfield and in the iconic scene where uncle Ben gets stabbed he is saying his last words to Peter " with great power comes etc etc " anyway kor then made a joke saying " How many people even have last words in these situations like if I get stabbed  i would fucking on the floor screaming".. And then I thought "what do I want my last words to be?  " and this thought popped into my head . That's the backstory <This message was edited>

28/01/25, 8:55 pm - Aditya👽: He said he will stop buying chips( the computer kind to be clear ) from tiwan ... Tiwan makes 80% of the world's chips ... This will destroy American Tech Hegemony in a month and he also announced that The federal american government will stop all aid given to Americans (basically welfare for poor , elderly, orphans etc ) from tmrw .... This will also drastically bring down the American economy. Either he is extremely stupid or is secretly an agent of china tasked with the destruction of America so china can remain the only Superpower <This message was edited>
